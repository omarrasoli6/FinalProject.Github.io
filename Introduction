            <h2>ðŸ”¹ What Technology Did We Choose?</h2>
            <p>Our team chose <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, a cutting-edge language model developed by <strong>OpenAI</strong>. ChatGPT is a form of <strong>Generative AI</strong>, specifically designed to understand and generate human-like text. It belongs to a family of models called <strong>GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)</strong>, with the most recent versions demonstrating powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, conversation, content creation, summarization, and even coding.</p>
            <p>Powered by deep learning and trained on vast datasets from books, websites, and other text sources, ChatGPT can carry out contextual dialogues, generate articles, write code, and more â€” all with astonishing coherence and fluidity.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ”¹ Why Did We Choose ChatGPT?</h2>
            <p>We selected ChatGPT because it sits at the center of a technological and ethical revolution. Since its public release in late 2022, ChatGPT has transformed industries including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education</strong> (homework help, tutoring, plagiarism concerns),</li>
                <li><strong>Business</strong> (customer service, content writing, decision support),</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> (medical advice, mental health apps),</li>
                <li><strong>Software development</strong> (code generation, debugging assistance),</li>
                <li><strong>Media</strong> (AI journalism, storytelling, and creative writing).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The pace at which ChatGPT has been adopted is unmatched, but it also brings <strong>deep ethical questions</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How should society respond to jobs potentially displaced by AI?</li>
                <li>What responsibilities do developers have when releasing powerful AI tools?</li>
                <li>How do we address <strong>bias, misinformation, or misuse</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These questions â€” and their real-world implications â€” make ChatGPT the perfect focus for a critical ethical discussion.</p>
